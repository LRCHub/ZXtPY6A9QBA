What I want is at my fingers
What now?
Stop running
Ya know me as that
chick who won't back down
I'm coming
The gun who threatens
your empire
A fire
An urge to be bad
You can't expect
to meet the angel that you had
Now!
The tables have turned, hah
The bridges I burned
with desire
For human applause, plause
Rewind and relive and relay
All the 死 that
I've wanted to say
I beckon you all to be part of
(The making it known,
my assent to the throne?)
Human kind's got secret lusts
A voice to take them higher
I got no delusions
My own revolution
Your misconstrued
Myth come true
Come on!!
Make 'em afraid of ya
Make 'em afraid of ya
Make 'em afraid of ya
Guess I'm the Queen of Fools!
They see what they wanna,
no duh
Said to myself "no losing"
"Make 'em afraid of ya"
Ready to break some rules
An evil ya can't help but love
If you got the stuff to prove it
Make 'em afraid of ya
Too far?
I'm outta my mind
Chase the night
Slay the light
Feel the animal seeking a bite
Bare my teeth (and?)
cry out as I clench
through the pain
Nay-sayers want nothing
to change
And their prayers are 邪邪邪魔!!
So what?
Ya think I'm no good?
Don't act like gods should?
The joke's on you,
the sky's their limit!
Disguise my ambitions
Make my own decisions
Defiant, on the brink watch
their kingdom start to fall
Human kind's got secret lusts
A voice to take them higher
I'm ready and willin'
So make me your villain
Your misconstrued
Myth come true
Come on!!
Make 'em afraid of ya
Make 'em afraid of ya
Make 'em afraid of ya
Guess I'm the Queen of Fools!
They see what they wanna,
no duh
Said to myself "no losing"
"Make 'em afraid of ya"
Ready to break some rules
An evil ya can't help but love
If you got the stuff to prove it
Make 'em afraid of ya
Goodbye
To life on the cautious side
I'll watch as it burns down
I got no delusions
My own revolution
Your misconstrued
Myth come true
Come on!!
Make 'em afraid of ya
Make 'em afraid of ya
Make 'em afraid of ya
Guess I'm the Queen of Fools!
They see what they wanna,
no duh
Said to myself "no losing"
"Make 'em afraid of ya"
Ready to break some rules
An evil ya can't help but love
If you got the stuff to prove it
Make 'em afraid of ya
Make 'em afraid of ya
